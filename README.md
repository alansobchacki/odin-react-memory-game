Project: Memory Card
=============

A Memory game where a user must click every image exactly once to win.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://odin-react-memory-game.vercel.app/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [React](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react) curriculum. It is the second project required for completion of the React Course [2/3].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Implement a scoreboard, which counts the current score. 
- [x] Add a “Best Score” feature to your scoreboard, which shows the highest score you’ve achieved thus far.
- [x] Add a feature where cards are shuffled once a user clicks any card.
- [x] The cards must display images. Informational text is optional.
- [x] These card images need to be fetched from an external API.

What I Learned
-----

I had a chance to practice my skills with the useState hook and learned about a new hook, useEffect.

Notes
-----

While I'm still getting acquainted with React, I didn't struggle as much as I did while working on my first React app. 

Browsing React's documentation paid off. 

I'm getting the hang of using useState better. It was also nice having to work with asynchronous functions again since this project involved API calls.

Ironically, I'm learning React, but the biggest struggle was handling the API calls within React. Nothing major, but still.

Also, keep in mind that the game theme was optional. Several students made games around their favorite shows/games. I made my game about Asian food because it was easier to find APIs with food images.
